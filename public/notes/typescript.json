You might get type-checking errors, but that won't stop you from running the resulting JavaScript. While you can go for stricter behavior, that means you're still in control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypeScript code is transformed into JavaScript code via the TypeScript compiler or \u003ca href=\"babel\"\u003eBabel\u003c/a\u003e. This JavaScript is clean, simple code which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on \u003ca href=\"node-js\"\u003eNode.JS\u003c/a\u003e or in your apps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eGradual Adoption\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdopting TypeScript is not a binary choice, you can start by annotating existing JavaScript with JSDoc, then switch a few files to be checked by TypeScript and over time prepare your codebase to convert completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypeScript’s type inference means that you don’t have to annotate your code until you want more safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
